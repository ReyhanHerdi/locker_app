                    "When looking for a new job, you may encounter posts or communications advertising fake jobs or career opportunities.\n" +
                    "These advertisements or messages typically aim to steal your personal information or money, so it's important to avoid clicking any links or submitting any details to these scammers.\n" +

                    "17 common job scams\n" +
                    "Scammers use a variety of strategies to trick people into sharing personal information. Here are 17 common job scams to avoid:\n" +
                    "1. Fake job listings\n" +
                    "Fake job listings come in various forms. Though job sites have measures in place to verify legitimate employers, scammers sometimes manage to get their listings posted. Other fake listings appear on social media profiles created expressly to deceive job seekers. The listings normally ask candidates to pay a fee to complete their application or to get started in the role. \n" +
                    "2. Imposters\n" +
                    "An imposter is someone purporting to be someone else. In the context of job scams, they usually pose as an affiliate of an agency, government institution or hiring firm. Imposters often ask candidates for a screening fee in the form of gift cards or a wire transfer.\n" +
                    "3. Email offers\n" +
                    "You may receive an email from someone claiming to be a recruiter who found your resume on a job board. Some emails come from legitimate recruiters, but others may come from dishonest people trying to deceive you. Often, the dishonest ones ask you for sensitive information, such as identification or bank account numbers.\n" +
                    "4. Informational material\n" +
                    "Scammers who offer \"informational material\" often pose as hiring experts who can optimize your candidacy for a position. For a fee, they promise to give you essential information that can help you both secure and prepare for an interview with the company you want. In reality, such information is normally available on the employer's website, their job listing or various free sources and the purported adviser reaching out to you has little of value to offer.\n" +
                    "5. Interviews via an online messaging service\n" +
                    "In this type of scam, the scammer notifies you that you've been selected as one of the finalists for a position, usually one to which you never applied. When it comes time to arrange an interview, they may reveal that it's an online interview through a specific messaging service, which asks you to input personal information to complete the setup. The scammer can then access the information you've provided. \n" +
                    "6. Money laundering\n" +
                    "A common money laundering strategy involves the scammer reaching out to you via email or a job listing. They may try to convince you to accept a sum of money and to use your personal bank account to transfer it to another account, allowing you to keep a percentage. Usually, their rationale behind this circuitous transmission is that it would be easier and more efficient to use your account instead of theirs. The scammer is actually trying to acquire your bank account information.\n" +
                    "7. Credit reports\n" +
                    "In a common credit report scam, the scammer claims that an examination of your credit history is necessary to verify your eligibility for the position. They may say that the job requires someone who's financially responsible. The fake employer might then ask you to pay for a credit report with your credit card, which results in their charging an unauthorized fee for it. Otherwise, they may suggest using a specific service to obtain the credit report, which you end up paying for in addition to other charges. While real employers do sometimes perform credit checks on employees, very rarely do they ask the candidate to cover the cost. Credible companies typically handle credit checks on their own. \n" +
                    "8. Career consulting\n" +
                    "Career consulting scams occur when a person posing as a career consultant reaches out to you to praise your resume. They then mention that it could be better with some additional work. They either offer to improve your resume themselves or refer you to an alleged expert in exchange for a fee. \n" +
                    "9. Work-from-home jobs\n" +
                    "The past few years have seen an increase in candidates seeking work-from-home positions. Scammers are aware of the rising popularity of remote work and target such candidates with work-from-home job scams. Often, the scam involves persuading a job seeker to pay a fee or purchase items. \n" +
                    "For example, the position may require you to submit an initial registration fee to start, with the promise of commissions if you can get others to sign on, too. If the job exists, it's likely a type of pyramid scheme or multilevel marketing organization. \n" +
                    "10. Shipping schemes\n" +
                    "Also known as postal fraud, shipping schemes are a subcategory of work-from-home scams. The scammer offers an attractive salary for repackaging and reshipping goods, plus compensation for shipping fees. In most cases, the candidate ends up shipping potentially stolen items and paying for the shipping fees without the promised compensation or salary.\n" +
                    "11. Government jobs\n" +
                    "If a listing or offer for a supposed government job asks you to pay a fee to apply or acquire information that can improve your candidacy, it's a scam. Government agencies don't require fees for candidates. Also, many government jobs are accessible only through official channels, such as USA Jobs. \n" +
                    "12. Equipment purchases\n" +
                    "Some fraudulent employers claim to offer a candidate a remote job and then ask the candidate to submit payment for their remote work equipment, like a computer and monitor. Typically, the scammer claims the payment is mandatory before they can officially onboard you, and they promise to reimburse you on your paycheck. Once they receive payment, they keep the money and cease all contact. Some employers require employees to use their own equipment, but it's highly uncommon for a legitimate employer to ask you to submit payment directly to them for it.\n" +
                    "13. Envelope stuffing\n" +
                    "This scam advertises a remote job filling envelopes for a company, typically with the promise of surprisingly high weekly pay. The scammer requires a one-time payment before you can start, claiming this money covers supplies and processing. When you submit the payment and receive your assignment in the mail, it's usually a paper stating that, instead of stuffing envelopes, your only job is to recruit another person for the scam.\n" +
                    "14. Career advancement grants\n" +
                    "If you receive an email encouraging you to apply for a \"career advancement grant\" from the government, proceed with caution. These scams usually claim the recipient is eligible for a grant to pay for higher education or professional development services. The email may include links to applications and state that the government may deposit money directly into your account if your application is approved. Sometimes, the sender claims they're with a specific government agency.\n" +
                    "In reality, these fake grants aim to steal personal information or money from you. According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the government never sends unexpected communications about grant opportunities.\n" +
                    "15. High-paying data entry jobs\n" +
                    "One of the industries scammers target most commonly is data entry. Scammers often advertise illegitimate data entry jobs, claiming you can earn extremely high wages for little work. These jobs are rarely real, and after offering you a position, the fraudulent employer may ask you to pay for training or share your bank account information.\n" +
                    "If you see a data entry job offering a wage that seems much higher than the market average, investigate the company. Try to verify its legitimacy and research its reputation before you apply or respond to communications. \n" +
                    "16. Mystery shopper jobs\n" +
                    "It's also common for scammers to advertise mystery shopping jobs on job boards and public forums. These postings may claim you can work a flexible schedule and earn a high salary by shopping online or in person and evaluating retailers' customer service and offerings. If you're seeking a mystery shopper position, be wary of companies that ask you to submit any payment upfront. They're rarely credible and typically collect payment without any intention of assigning you work. \n" +
                    "17. Resale gigs\n" +
                    "For this scam, the scammers target candidates seeking supplemental income from a side hustle. They may contact you by phone or email informing you of an opportunity to buy luxury goods, such as clothes, appliances, tech or accessories, at a discount. They then resell those items for profit. They help you purchase inventory, but they never send you the items.\n",

            "Practical tips to avoid getting trapped in a job scam",
            "Here are some practical tips on how to avoid falling prey to job scams:\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "1. Check for known red flags\n" +
                    "For any communication coming your wat that you haven't initiated, look out for some obvious red flags to verify authenticity of the sender:\n" +
                    "•\tThe company has no website or official social media accounts\n" +
                    "•\tThe domain in the recruiter’s email address does not match the correct, official website of a legitimate company or organization\n" +
                    "•\tJob details are sent on Whatsapp/SMS/telegram or from unofficial email accounts\n" +
                    "•\tThe job description is vague, unclear and has many typos or grammatical mistakes\n" +
                    "•\tThe focus is not on roles & responsibilities but more on attractive salaries, quick benefits etc.\n" +
                    "2. You are asked to divulge personal information\n" +
                    "Although it’s a normal practice for companies to seek your personal information, it is almost always done at later stages of recruitment, once offer letter is given out. But be extra careful on what information they ask for, for example, bank account details are something which should never be shared. Before signing any documents or forms asking for sensitive data, make sure you verify if that information is really required as often scammers might misuse your personal data.\n" +
                    "3. Never pay money!\n" +
                    "Scammers often ask for payments to be made in the name of application fee, deposit or in lieu of reserving a seat for you. Never pay heed to such requests to pay money. A genuine and trusted recruiter or a recruiting company will never ask for money at any stage of your recruitment process or in exchange for their services.\n" +
                    "4. Too good to be true\n" +
                    "In a market where employers are trying to stand out, if you find a job offer that is all about making quick money and other incentives – proceed with caution! Read the job details and skills requirement carefully. If you find there is less information on the actual role and more about added benefits – that’s your red flag.\n" +
                    "5. Do your research & check with credible sources\n" +
                    "Before accepting any interview offers or sharing any information, do your due diligence and do background research on the company. Understand the company’s background, business field and look out for any sign that might look suspicious. When in doubt, check if the company is registered and if their contact details are legitimate. You can also discuss it with you friends or family to get second opinion on the authenticity of the company.\n" +
                    "Overall, the best way to handle such situations is to simply ignore. Whenever you get some unsolicited job postings which look fishy, simply don’t respond. Such job scams require active engagement from both sides, so if you don’t act on it, it reduces the chances of falling into such traps altogether.\n",

            "5 tips to protect yourself from job scams ",
            "1. Do your research\n" +
                    "Before applying for a position, conduct thorough research on the company to establish its existence and verify identifying details. Use a search engine to find the employer's official website and social media pages, which can provide useful information that you can compare against what you find in job listings or emails. You might find, for example, the email handle of the employer's human resources department. If you received a recruitment email from a different handle, you can tell that the sender is a scammer.\n" +
                    "2. Verify website security\n" +
                    "You can avoid illegitimate jobs by verifying websites and their security measures. Make sure the web address includes \"https://\" at the beginning, not \"http://.\" This verifies that the site is both authentic and secure. You can also determine how long the site has been active and who owns it by inputting its URL into a domain age and website registry tool.\n" +
                    "3. Trust your instincts\n" +
                    "If you remain suspicious of a job or employer even after your research, trust yourself. If you feel uncertain, uncomfortable or jeopardized by an opportunity, avoiding it is the best course of action. Even if you can confirm the company is real, your feelings may be a sign that your values and interests differ from the employer's.\n" +
                    "4. Protect your personal information\n" +
                    "Keep your bank account information, credit card number, social security number and all other sensitive information safe from strangers online, even if they ask for it. Legitimate employers don't ask for payment card information at all, and they don't request banking or federal identifying information until they've hired you. If a recruiter or employer asks for these details early on, consider terminating your communication with them.\n" +
                    "5. Look for complaints\n" +
                    "Job sites often have review sections where employees and candidates share the experiences they had with an employer. Search for a potential employer on these sites and see what others have said. Their remarks can reveal whether the employer is legitimate and thus guide your decision to move forward. You can also check the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to learn if the company has negative reviews or claims of fraud.\n",

            "While job scammers have adapted their tactics over time, there are still some hard-and-fast warnings that a job is a scam. Here are some basic signs of a work-from-home job scam:\n" +
                    "•\tYou’re asked for personal financial information—such as your social security number, your bank account, your home address and phone number, your date of birth, etc.—early on in the job interview process.\n" +
                    "•\tThe job pays a lot of money for little work. After all, if it sounds too good to be true, it almost always is.\n" +
                    "•\tThe company boasts several rags-to-riches stories that showcase high-flying lifestyles.\n" +
                    "•\tThe job posting mentions quick money, drastic income changes overnight, etc.\n" +
                    "•\tThe job posting has glaring grammatical or spelling errors.\n" +
                    "•\tThe product is supposedly endorsed by countless celebrities or public figures.\n" +
                    "•\tThe contact email address is personal (e.g., johnsmith3843@gmail.com) or one that mimics a real company’s email address (e.g., johnsmith@dellcomputercompany.com).\n" +
                    "•\tThe job requires several up-front expenses from candidates.\n" +
                    "•\tCompensation is based on how many people you recruit.\n" +
                    "•\tA recruiter offers you the job immediately without verifying your work experience or doesn’t ask for references.\n" +
                    "In one of the latest remote work scams, the FTC reports that the operators of a work-from-home scheme used “misleading spam emails to lure consumers into buying work-from-home services.” These emails used fake news stories and fake celebrity endorsements to convince consumers to purchase. In total, the settlements with the operators of this scheme imposed an \$11.3 million judgment.\n" +
                    "“Unfortunately, online job scams remain a troubling component of the work-from-home job market, even as the number of legitimate remote job opportunities continues to grow. It’s encouraging to see this settlement, but job seekers should not let their guard down—many, many more scams still exist,” said the Career Experts.\n",

            "If you've already been subject to a scam, here are some steps you can take to minimize the consequences:\n" +
                    "1. Inform your bank\n" +
                    "If the scammer stole your bank information, asked you to send a check or processed a charge on your credit card, call your bank immediately and tell them what happened. They may be able to cancel the check or reverse the fraudulent charges. They can also help you change your information to secure your account.\n" +
                    "2. Block communications from the sender\n" +
                    "It's important that the sender is unable to scam you any further. Most email providers allow you to block a sender and report their messages as spam. If the scammer called or text-messaged you, block their phone number, too.\n" +
                    "3. Report the scam\n" +
                    "The FTC collects information about potential scams to help other consumers and candidates. If you're comfortable sharing your experience, you can submit a report about the fraudulent company so the government can investigate it. If you see a fraudulent job advertised on a job board or search engine, it can be helpful to report the posting, too.\n" +
                    "4. Turn on identity fraud and credit alerts\n" +
                    "Your bank may offer credit and identity monitoring services. If someone uses your information, such as by applying for a credit card with your name and social security number, you receive a notification instantly. This can be an effective way to resolve any concerns before they escalate.\n",

                    "The Prevalence of Job Scams in Today's Digital Age\n" +
                    "Job scams have been around for as long as there have been job openings, but with the rise of the internet and social media, they have become more prevalent and sophisticated. Scammers can easily create fake job postings and websites that look legitimate, and they often use fake names and email addresses to make their offers seem more convincing. In many cases, scammers will even conduct fake interviews to try to gain access to your personal information or convince you to pay for a background check or training program.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    " One of the most insidious aspects of job scams is that they often prey on vulnerable populations, such as recent graduates, retirees, and stay-at-home parents. These groups may be more likely to fall for scams due to their eagerness to find a job or their lack of experience navigating the job market.\n" +

                    "- Common Types of Job Scams and How They Work\n" +
                    "\\nWork from Home Scam: Job scams can take many different forms, but there are a few common types that you should be aware of. One of the most common is the \"work-from-home\" scam, in which scammers offer you the opportunity to work from home and make a lot of money with little effort. These scams often require you to pay for training or equipment upfront, and the promised work never materializes.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Fake Job Posting: Fake job postings are also a common scam.

In some cases, scammers will even conduct fake interviews to try to get your personal information.\n" +

                    "The job market in India has its fair share of scams, making it essential for job seekers to be vigilant and informed. Job scams come in various forms, including fake job postings, work-from-home schemes, and fraudulent interviews. These scams can result in lost money, time, and personal information. Here are some tips to spot and avoid job scams in India:\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Beware of unrealistic job postings: If the job posting promises an unusually high salary, little effort or qualifications required, or a guarantee of employment, it is likely to be a scam.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Research the company: Check the company's website, social media pages, and reviews to verify if the company and job offer are legitimate. If the website looks unprofessional or lacks contact details, it may be a red flag.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Don't pay any upfront fees: Legitimate employers will never ask you to pay for anything upfront, such as a background check or training program. If a company asks for an upfront payment, it's likely to be a scam.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Protect your personal information: \n" +
                    "\\nScammers may ask for your sensitive information such as Aadhaar, bank account number, or PAN card details. Be cautious about providing this information unless you are confident about the company's legitimacy.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "- Be wary of unsolicited emails: \n" +
                    "\\nBe cautious of emails from companies you have not applied to. Scammers use fake emails to trick job seekers into sharing their personal information.\n" +

            "Lisa Miner thought she had found the perfect new job: Earlier this year, the dialysis technician got an offer to be an app developer for CVS Health after passing a skills test administered by a purported recruiter who had reached out via a personal Gmail account. But the job wasn’t just fake — it was a ploy to steal her money.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The quick onboarding process sketched out Miner after the supposed recruiter told her that the company planned to send her a \$3,500 certified check to spend with a specific vendor for her work supplies — a process that sounded strange. Instead of immediately ordering her supplies when the check arrived, as she was instructed, Miner waited to see if the check would clear with her bank before spending any of her own money. It didn’t, validating Miner’s fear: She was dealing with a scammer.\n" +
                    "Luckily for Miner, who lives in Dallas, Ga., she hadn’t been able to reach her boss to resign — otherwise she could have ended up unemployed.\n" +
                    "“How can I really be that dumb?” she remembers asking herself. “I was harder on myself than anything.”\n" +
                    "Miner, who applied to openings on job sites such LinkedIn and Indeed and published posts about her job hunt, has company. Experts say scammers are targeting job seekers, a group that is growing as companies across industries continue laying people off, and they are especially going after those pursuing remote positions. Scammers are posting fake job openings on websites and are posing as recruiters in an attempt to steal everything from passwords to money and identities.\n" +
                    "“Job scammers are trying to prey on people’s desire to be flexible,” said Sinem Buber, lead economist at job search engine ZipRecruiter. “It’s a peak time because of that.”\n" +
                    "Job sites such as ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn and Indeed say they try to weed out fake job listings and employers, though scammers are getting more sophisticated. These websites also offer tools to flag suspicious content in case a scam gets past their screening. Still, many job seekers are airing their horror stories across social media.\n" +
                    "But experts say that if you’re looking for a job, even a remote one, don’t fret. There are steps you can take to skip the scams and get the real gig.\n" +
                    "“The majority will be legitimate,” said Stacey Perkins, career and leadership coach at recruiting firm Korn Ferry. “You just have to be careful.”\n" +
                    "Miner reported the scammer to the FBI, but she hasn’t received a response from the scammer or the FBI since. CVS Health advises job seekers to check the company’s career website to ensure a posting is real. The company also said it will never ask job candidates to join a Google Hangout, purchase their own equipment or pay to apply. And it will never send emails from a third-party email service such as Yahoo or Gmail.\n" +

                    "\n" +
                    "Avoid opportunities that promote easy money. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is, Perkins and Buber agreed. Job scams often play up little work for big paychecks. And they frequently promote that they are not a scam. “If they have to say that [they are legitimate], it’s a flag,” Perkins said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Get the details of the job. Legitimate jobs will explain the specific job duties, often in the listing. Be wary of jobs that require you to receive something, repackage it and send it somewhere new, especially if you don’t know the details. During the holidays, scammers may promote gift-wrapping jobs, Buber said. But you could be trafficking illegal materials.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Watch for spelling and grammar. If a post or outreach is riddled with spelling and grammar errors, experts agree that it’s probably a scam. A typo may just be a typo, but if a message is hard to read or full of obvious errors, move on. Also watch for one-letter differences in a company’s name, email or web address, Perkins said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "<b> Research the company. </b>  Most companies have a web presence, Buber said. Check the company’s website, and see if it has a LinkedIn account, social media profile or comments on the employee review site Glassdoor, experts advise. Can you connect with others who work there? Can you find an address to its headquarters? Does it actually exist?\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Check the trusted sources.  The Federal Trade Commission can provide details on cases against companies. And the Better Business Bureau accredits companies it deems trustworthy. Buber said a quick search could save you a headache later.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Look at the sender’s email address and profile. A recruiter or hiring manager should always be communicating with you via their company’s email account, never their personal Gmail or text message, for example. So make sure when responding or writing emails, the address matches the company’s web domain, Perkins said. If they’re reaching out to you on social media, do they have connections or posts? Are they interacting with others? Over how much time?\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Pay attention to the process.   Companies should be able to spell out their hiring process, Perkins said. If a company is eager to hire quickly and responses come within minutes, those could be red flags, Indeed warned. LinkedIn says employers rarely hire after one remote interview, and Indeed said that is especially true if the interview is over a text-based messaging service. Most employers will connect you to multiple people before you get the job.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Don’t pay for anything. If the employer asks you to pay for materials, training or testing, even if it offers reimbursement, the job is probably a scam, Perkins said. Buber said scammers often send victims a fake check and ask them to pay for something or claim that they need to send some back because an error. Scammers are able to then steal money by cashing in victims’ valid check or payment before the fake check bounces. Scammers could also use you as a money mule, asking you to deposit a valid check and send the same amount somewhere else, Buber said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Protect your personal information. While applying, don’t give your social security number, pictures of an ID or passport, or any financial details, such as your bank account or credit card number, experts say. “They need your contact information, and that’s it,” Perkins said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Get all questions answered. Go to every interview with questions, and make sure they get answered. Real employers will view that as interest, and fake ones will panic or avoid answering, Buber said.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Watch for pyramid schemes. Don’t fall for job opportunities in which you get paid only if you lure more people into the operation, Perkins said. Some multilevel marketing companies are legitimate, but many are pyramid schemes.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Trust your instincts. If something feels amiss, it probably is, experts say. So keep moving. “There are 1.7 jobs available for every unemployed person right now,” Buber said. “You will find something.”\n",

                    "The name and address of the office is not clear\n" +
                    "Have you ever found an interview invitation from the company whose name is foreign or unclear and has doubts about its authenticity? You can search for the data with a type 'fiber + office name', through a Google search engine. You will detect discussions from people who have applied or worked there. You can also recognize fake company records on online forums such as Quora or Kaskus. Make sure you know the truth before arriving there or continuing the recruitment process.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Raising fees for candidates\n" +
                    "Fake vacancies will generally ask job applicants to send some money for the recruitment process with various alibis. They argued that the money was used to buy plane tickets, rent a training place, pay for training, or administration. They also promised that if the money that had been transferred would be returned after you became employees.\n" +
                    "For that, you need to be on guard when receiving an interview invitation like this. No responsibility, they let alone on behalf of big industries or SOEs. Remember, the original industry has never asked for anything from the interview to the offline letter. You are looking for a job to pay for, not to pay.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Requirements are very easy\n" +
                    "Did you have job vacancies with unreasonable provisions? Without tests, receiving all levels of learning, no need for work experience, let alone being immediately accepted and being able to work tomorrow. This is one of the characteristics if the vacancy is fake.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Requesting personal data\n" +
                    "Vacancies for fake jobs generally ask for data or information on individual candidates. For example, family card no (KK), ID card number, NPWP, or asking you to send selfie images with your ID card. Don't give it, remember that individual information is confidential, so you must be careful.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Calling it a fantastic honorarium\n" +
                    "To attract the attention of potential victims, fake lockers generally include fantastic income and allowances on the work invitation sheet. Meanwhile, HRD wants to inform you after you pass the test session and interview via offering letter.\n" +
                    "Salaries are very confidential information between industry and employees, so it's unethical to talk about if you are still a candidate. Not only that, with very easy requirements as well as an obscure job description, isn't it suspicious if a candidate can earn a huge amount of income? Until then, don't be easily fooled by the lure of a fraudster.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Bad writing on invitations\n" +
                    "Generally fake job vacancies have unfavorable writing in their invitations. Fraudsters often use non-standard language, difficult sentences to understand, messy EYD, miscomposition, and industrial logos that are gepeng and appear a kind of edit. If you receive an interview invitation like this, don't get caught immediately. You must be vigilant and read the invitation carefully. There's nothing wrong if you ask your friends or other people about the invitation.\n",

                    "Potential employees need to be aware that no middlemen can help them get into a job. All leading companies irrespective of whether they make it to Forbes 500 or not, use one scientific tool one way or another to measure candidature.

                    "2. Examine The Sender's Email Address\n" +
                    "To avoid being scammed, candidates should ensure the legitimacy of job application emails by examining the email address from which they receive requests. Genuine companies will neither call nor text candidates to collect candidates' personally identifiable information (PII), such as date of birth and national identification nor will they ask for money to advance the job application. - Siddharth Sharma- JP Morgan Chase & Co.\n" +

                    "Often, the mainstream validation and easy authentication of job search platforms may make you judge your own intuition. However, suspicious third-party agencies hide among the reliable ads, making many potential candidates land in trouble. Not sharing confidential details before getting the offer letter is a step we are all aware of, my advice would be to verify the identity of your future leaders. - Muninder Anand, Center for Creative Leadership\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "4. Review The Firm's Online Presence\n" +
                    "Review the firm's online presence on sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook; are there recent social media posts? How long have their employees worked for the company? Another way is to see if they've had any recent reviews on Google. Finally, ask to speak to other employees working at the firm. If they refuse this request, it's typically a sign they're hiding something. - Jordan Young, AMX Healthcare, Inc\n" +

                    "5. Interview The Company Thoroughly\n" +
                    "Stay vigilant! Interview the company as thoroughly as they interview you. Research the company you are applying to and never provide personal or financial information unless you're certain that the job offer is genuine. Be mindful to not let desperation for a job cloud your judgment. Remember, you are in charge of you. Keep in mind that you are valuable, and don't be afraid to ask the hard questions. - Jess Elmquist, Phenom\n" +

                    "Do not engage with any search firm that requires you to pay to gain access to roles you are interested in! Search firms with a substantial client list and active job searches will never ask you to pay them to be part of their candidate pool. The same advice goes for job boards. The only parties that should be paying to use a job board are employers. - Alexandria Brown, The HR Hacker\n" +

                    "If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of companies that encourage you to move or hire others to make money selling something—these pyramid schemes don't work out well for most people. Look closely at online review sites—if people say they didn't get paid, you won't either. Never join a company that requires your money—they should be paying you, not the other way around. - Tracy Cote, StockX\n" +

Proper background checks can protect job seekers from fraud. - Bala Sathyanarayanan, Greif Inc\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "9. Research The Firm's Alumni\n" +
                    "It depends on the industry, but the general advice is to look at the firm's alumni. For how long have the individuals stayed on average, and how has their career progressed after leaving the firm? What you're looking for is that leavers in general maintain similar or higher functions and don't entirely switch careers. There's a consistency you can rely on. - Nick Frey, Avomind\n" +

                    "Transparency in the hiring process, especially within the company's identity and mission, job description and salary information, is a hallmark of a credible business that values best hiring practices. Avoid applying with a company that requires too much personal information up front before an official offer is made or offers no face-to-face contact of any kind throughout the interview process. - Laura Spawn, Virtual Vocations, Inc.\n" +

To avoid them, job seekers should research the company and job posting thoroughly, watch for suspicious activity and trust their instincts. By taking these steps, job seekers can protect themselves and find legitimate employment opportunities. A big red flag would be any company or service asking job seekers for a fee to help them get a job. - William Stonehouse, Crawford Thomas Recruiting\n" +

                    "Job scams are becoming increasingly common, so job seekers should verify the company’s website, research reviews of the business and rely on their instincts to detect red flags.

                    "Apply the golden rule: ''When in doubt, throw it out.'' Always research a company before accepting any job offer. Check their website, social media presence and reviews. It could be a red flag if they ask for personal or financial information before a formal offer. Be wary of any job that promises high pay for minimal work or requires upfront payment. Trust your instincts, and ask questions. - Joseph Soares, IBPROM Corp.\n" +

            "Job fraud reports almost tripled in the pandemic years from 2020 to 2021, and Bloomberg has reported that numbers will continue to grow in 2023. What makes the situation even more tricky is that job scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated, sometimes creating emails and even websites that can look like they belong to a real company. Sometimes they manage to slip past legit job sites like Indeed or ZipRecruiter with fake job listings and they have also been known to hack legitimate companies’ LinkedIn accounts to contact potential “employees.”\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Job offer scam emails: How job scammers target you\n" +
                    "In many cases, job scams come in the form of an email with an unsolicited job offer. In the scam mail, you’ll be offered a chance to apply or interview for a great-paying job – usually a position with flexible hours that allows you to work from home. Just like in other forms of phishing scams, such emails will often be faked to look like they come from a well-known company or recruitment site.  \n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Here’s a list of five common work-at-home job scams:\n" +
                    "1. Fake check job scams\n" +
                    "A company reaches out to you with a great opportunity to work from home – and of course you’ll need a laptop and all the rest of the IT equipment that makes remote work possible. After you have signed your contract, your new employer will send you a cashier’s check and ask you to purchase your supplies from a specific vendor. But once you have made the purchase you learn that their check never cleared, and the equipment never arrives. The vendor was simply a front for the scammer, and you lose all the money you paid them.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "These remote job scams that send checks are possible because banks are required to make the money from deposited checks available within a day or two. So the amount of the fake employer’s check will initially appear in your bank balance and you’ll feel secure making the purchase. However, when the bank discovers it can’t access the funds after all – a process that can take a week or two – your bank will still expect you to cover the purchase you made. According to the FTC, the median reported loss on fake check job scams is 2,300 US dollars.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "2. Harvesting personal information\n" +
                    "When you are hired for a job, at some point you need to give your employer personal information like your social security number or your banking information so they can pay you. Some employment scams hurry people along through a fake hiring process with the goal of obtaining this data– or ask for it early on in the fake application process. Once the scammers have enough information about an individual, they can use it for purposes like identity theft schemes.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "3. Job ad phishing emails\n" +
                    "Not only might a job offer scam email be phishing for your personal information, but sometimes they are designed to get you to click on dangerous links. Such emails often look like they come from trusted companies, but clicking the link promising you “more information” about the position or opening an attached file that claims to contain the job description will instead infect your device with malware or take you to a fraudulent website.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "4. Reshipping jobs\n" +
                    "Another email job scam that offers easy, flexible hours working from home involves receiving parcels and repackaging and reshipping them. Although these jobs are often advertised as logistics positions or, near the holidays, even as gift-wrapping positions, in fact this postal forwarding usually involves transferring stolen goods. This means that anyone who falls for this employment scam will also unintentionally become involved in a criminal activity. And although they are promised a good wage – and often even pay the shipping charges out of pocket expecting to be reimbursed – their so-called employer will usually break off contact without ever paying them.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "5. Data entry job scams\n" +
                    "A company sends you a fraudulent job posting offering work-from-home position doing data entry. Although there are indeed legitimate remote data-entry jobs out there, this scam is different – it offers a much higher wage than would be normal for an entry-level job requiring minimum qualifications. However, the applicant is asked to make an upfront payment for “processing” or “training,” with the promise of reimbursement with the first month’s paycheck. After the online training is completed, no paycheck arrives and the fake employer vanishes.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "How to know if a job is a scam\n" +
                    "As we noted above, it can be very hard to tell if a job email is fake. Scammers have gotten very good at imitating the correspondence and websites of legitimate employers and may even hack into a real company’s LinkedIn or other social media accounts. With this in mind, you should always treat an unsolicited job offer with skepticism. Here are ten clues that an email might be a fake job scam.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "How to identify job scams:\n" +
                    "1.\tThe offer seems too good to be true, e.g. promising a lot of money for very little work.\n" +
                    "There is a false sense of urgency – the recruiter places you under pressure, saying that you have to act now. You receive replies to your responses within hours or even minutes, rushing you along to the next step in the hiring process. If you feel unduly pressured, you should trust that feeling and break off contact.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "2.\tThe job asks you to receive products, repackage them, and send them somewhere else; \n" +
                    "or to accept funds in your bank account and transfer them to another party. Unfortunately, these are stolen goods trafficking or money laundering schemes.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "3.\tThe job email looks like it comes from a legitimate company, but it contains spelling or grammar mistakes or the name of the company is slightly off (e.g. Gooogle).\n" +
                    " Research the company by looking to see if it has a website (but don’t click any links in the post!), and perform an internet search for the company name plus the words “scam” and “fraud”.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "4.\tThe email sender address is a Gmail, Yahoo, or other private email account. \n" +
                    "This is a sign of a scam, as a real hiring manager or recruiter would have a company email address. Make sure to hover your mouse curser over the sender’s name to see the actual sender address.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "5.\tThe hiring process seems too simple or fast. \n" +
                    "A legit company looking to hire you will normally invite you to at least two in-person or video-conference interviews with multiple people. A solely text-based exchange is unheard of, and even a single remote interview with just one person is unusual enough to arouse suspicions.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "6.\tThe job requires you to pay for something from your bank account, whether for training or your own equipment. \n" +
                    "Often you are promised reimbursement with your first paycheck or you even receive a fraudulent check to cover your expenses. Either way, the likelihood of you seeing your money again is slim to none.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "7.\tYou are asked to provide a lot of personal information, like SSN, pictures of your ID or passports, or your bank account or credit card number very early in the application process, e.g. before the interview.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "8.\tYou are asked to download a special app or move to a different site (instead of Indeed, LinkedIn, etc.) for further communications.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "9.\tYou are offered a job without the employer asking for a CV, checking any references, or verifying your experience.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "How to know if a job offer is legit\n" +
                    "In general, it’s best to treat any unsolicited job offer as a potential scam, no matter where it comes from! However, if you think there is a chance that the job offer is legit, you can do some research to verify it. Perform your own internet search for the company in question. Check whether they have a website and an active social media presence.\n" +
                    "1.\tIf you find a legitimate-looking website, check their career page to see if the position you’ve been offered is listed. Try to call someone from the HR department using the contact information on the website and ask about the job opening. Reach out to employees of the company who have profiles on LinkedIn and ask how they like working for the company.\n" +
                    "2.\tOn the other hand, your internet search may turn up some red flags, like other people complaining about scams or poor reviews. This is a sign that you should look elsewhere for a job!\n" +
